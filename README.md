# Tenax - AI-Powered Consistency System Manager

**🚀 The First AI-Driven Consistency System Manager for Autodidactic Learners**

Tenax is not just another educational assistant—it's an **intelligent consistency system manager** designed for autodidactic students who refuse to depend on motivation or willpower alone. Built with cutting-edge technology (FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL), Tenax learns from your behavior, collects data on your study patterns, identifies personal blockers, and builds measurable, personalized strategies to help you advance, recover when you fall, and sustain long-term progress.

**🎯 Vision**: Transform how autodidactic learners build and maintain learning systems by providing AI-powered management that works even when motivation fails.

## 💡 Value Proposition

**More than an assistant, Tenax is your consistency system architect:**

- **🏗️ Builds your personalized consistency system** based on your data, lifestyle, and objectives
- **⚙️ Proposes and maintains routines, cycles, alarms, and automations** that dynamically adjust
- **🧠 Learns with you and evolves your strategy** - doesn't give motivation, gives structure
- **🔗 Integrates and orchestrates your current tools** (Platzi, Notion, Google Calendar, habit apps)
- **🤖 Uses agentic intelligence to act** even when you're disconnected or unmotivated

## 💡 The Need Statement - A Personal Journey

### **🎓 The Problem I Experienced**

As a **biomedical engineer graduate from Universidad de los Andes**, I faced a unique challenge that many professionals encounter today: **the need to continuously learn new skills outside my formal education**. After graduating, I embarked on a self-directed journey to master software development and artificial intelligence - a path that revealed critical gaps in how we approach learning:

**The Autodidact's Dilemma:**
- Scattered learning resources across multiple platforms and formats
- No structured way to track progress across diverse skill areas
- Difficulty maintaining consistent learning habits while working professionally  
- Lack of personalized guidance for complex technical subjects
- Overwhelming amount of information without clear learning pathways

**The Biomedical Perspective:**
Coming from biomedical engineering, I understood the importance of **systematic approaches, evidence-based decisions, and personalized treatments**. Yet in education, we were still using one-size-fits-all solutions.

### **🔍 The Insight**

The breakthrough came during my self-taught journey in AI and software development. While building a **personal knowledge management system** - essentially a custom "constancias" (evidence/record) manager for tracking my learning milestones, certifications, and skill development - I realized:

> **"Learning is like medicine - it should be personalized, evidence-based, and continuously optimized based on individual response."**

**The Biomedical Engineering Mindset Applied to Education:**
- **Diagnosis**: Identify individual learning patterns and challenges
- **Treatment**: Personalized learning interventions and recommendations  
- **Monitoring**: Continuous tracking and adjustment based on outcomes
- **Prevention**: Proactive identification of learning obstacles

### **🚀 The Solution Vision**

This unique intersection of **biomedical engineering thinking** and **self-directed learning experience** led to a powerful realization: **What if we could apply the same systematic, personalized approach we use in healthcare to optimize learning outcomes?**

Tenax evolved from this interdisciplinary insight:
- **From**: Manual tracking of learning constancias and achievements
- **To**: AI-powered "learning diagnosis and treatment" system
- **Result**: Personalized educational interventions that adapt like medical treatments

**The Autodidact Advantage**: Having learned software development and AI from scratch, I understand both the technical possibilities and the real learning challenges that traditional computer science education might miss.

**The LLM Era Insight**: In the age of Large Language Models and AI assistants, **being a successful autodidact becomes an invaluable skill**. The ability to learn independently, ask the right questions, and synthesize information from multiple sources is no longer just helpful—it's essential. Traditional education systems haven't adapted to this reality, but Tenax is designed to bridge this gap by teaching students not just what to learn, but **how to learn effectively in an AI-augmented world**.

### **🎯 Why This Matters**

Every student deserves a learning experience that adapts to them, not the other way around. My journey from building a simple constancias manager to envisioning Tenax represents a fundamental shift in educational technology - from static tools to intelligent, adaptive learning companions.

**In the LLM Era**: The future belongs to learners who can effectively collaborate with AI tools, continuously adapt to new technologies, and maintain lifelong learning habits. Tenax prepares students for this reality by making autodidactic skills accessible to everyone.

**The question that drives Tenax**: *"What if technology could understand how you learn best and automatically optimize your entire educational journey?"*
